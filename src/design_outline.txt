Planets, maybe one sun is enough
Rocket, presumably some way of zooming in and out
So then some way of differentiating between rendering "true look" of the rocket and an "icon"
N-body gravity. Newton's gravitation is enough
Planets are modeled as perfectly spherical, no oblateness. 2D so no orbit inclination
(reasonable for most planets, not so reasonable for e.g. pluto, very not reasonable for a lot of satelites)

Rocket is modeled as solid, without stresses, when in-flight as a single part. Although its "stats" can change



ultimately, maybe someday have asteroids, mining etc.
